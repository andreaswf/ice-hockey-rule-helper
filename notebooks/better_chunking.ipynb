If contact with \\nthe puck occurs while the puck is inside the defending zone, and subsequently goes out of play, the minor penalty shall be \\nassessed. When the puck is shot over the protective glass surrounding the Players’ bench, the penalty will be assessed.\\nNote: When the puck is shot into the Players’ bench, the penalty will not apply.

The determining factor shall be the \\nposition of the puck. Note: The minor penalty will not be assessed when a goalkeeper plays the puck while maintaining \\nskate contact with the goal crease.\\n(IX) For adjustments to clothing, equipment, skates, or sticks.
