When the opposing team has control of the \\npuck, play shall only be stopped if there is no immediate and impending scoring opportunity. This stoppage of play must be made \\nby the Referee. When play is stopped because the goalkeeper has lost their helmet and/ or face mask, the ensuing “face-off” shall \\ntake place at one of the defending team’s end zone face-off spots.\\nWhen a goalkeeper deliberately removes their helmet and/or face mask to secure a stoppage of play, the Referee shall stop play as \\noutlined above and assess the goalkeeper a minor penalty for “Delay of Game”. If the goalkeeper deliberately removes their helmet \\nand/or face mask when the opposing team is on a breakaway (where the criteria’s for a penalty shot is meet except for a foul from \\nbehind), or during the course of a “Penalty Shot” or shootout attempt, the Referee shall award a goal to the non-offending team.\\n ➔ Rule 63 – Delaying the Game.\\n9.7.

The visor face protection must be \\nproperly affixed to their helmet, and must extend down in such a fashion as to ensure adequate eye protection, to cover the eyes and \\nnose in its entirety. It must be fixed to the helmet along the sides so that it cannot be flipped up. A Player whose visor face protection \\nbecomes cracked or broken during game action must leave the ice immediately.\\nPlayers are not allowed to wear a colored or tinted visor that would make it impossible to make eye contact with the Player. \\nParticipating teams in an IIHF Competition must ensure that their Players are equipped with a helmet manufactured and approved\\nspecifically for ice hockey and that, as applicable, a visor or a full-face protection is properly attached to it.\\nSpecific rules and guidelines for appropriate head / face / mouth protection for Women\\'s Hockey and Men\\'s Junior “Under 20” and\\n03   SECTION · EQUIPMENT\\n\\n<<<PAGE 19>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 03  34\\nEQUIPMENT \\n“Under 18” categories.\\n ➔ Rule 102 – Women’s Hockey Specific Equipment and ➔ Rule 202 – Men’s Junior Hockey Specific Equipment.\\n9.8.

Failure to comply with \\nthe Referees’ instructions shall result in a minor penalty for “Delay of Game”. A mask or protector of a design approved by the IIHF \\nmay be worn by a Player who has sustained a facial injury.\\nIn the first instance, the injured Player shall be entitled to wear any protective device prescribed by the team doctor. If any opposing\\nteam objects to the device, it may record its objection with the IIHF .\\nIn cases where a stick may have been modified and it is evident that the edges have not been beveled, the Referee shall deem the \\nstick to be dangerous equipment and removed from the game until the edges can be beveled sufficiently.\\nNo penalty is to be assessed unless the Player returns to the ice with the unmodified stick, in which case they will be assessed\\na minor penalty.\\n ➔ Rule 63 – Delaying the Game. \\n9.9.

STICK MEASUREMENT \\nThere is no limit to the number of stick-measurement requests a team may make in a game, but a request for a stick measurement \\nshall be limited to one request per team during the course of any stoppage in play.\\nWhen a formal complaint is made by the Captain or Alternate Captain of a team against the dimensions of an opponent’s stick, that \\nopponent must be on the ice at the time the request is made to the Referee. It must be specified which part of the stick should be \\nmeasured.\\nOnce the request is made, and as long as the On-Ice Officials maintain visual contact with the stick, it can be measured. This means \\nthat if the Player whose stick is about to be measured steps off the ice onto their Players’ bench, their stick may still be measured \\nprovided the request was received prior to them leaving the ice surface and the stick remains in the view of at least one of the On-Ice \\nOfficials.\\nThe Referee shall take the stick to the penalty box where the necessary measurement shall be made immediately. Players on both \\nteams shall retire to their respective Players’ benches. To measure the curvature of the blade of the stick, the Referee must draw an \\nimaginary line along the outside of the shaft to the bottom of the blade and then along the bottom of the blade – this will determine \\nthe location of the heel. Using an IIHF-approved measuring gauge, the Referee shall secure the gauge at the heel of the stick and \\nmeasure the curvature of the blade from the heel to any point along the toe of the blade. To measure any other dimension of the \\nstick, the Referee shall use a measuring tape.\\nThe result shall be reported to the penalty timekeeper, who shall record it on the penalty record form. The Referee will convey the \\nresult of the measurement to the Captain or Alternate Captain of the team whose stick was measured.\\nA Player whose stick has been measured and it is found not to conform to the rule shall be assessed a minor penalty and the stick \\nwill be returned to the Players’ bench by the Referee. If the complaint is not sustained, a bench minor penalty shall be imposed \\nagainst the complaining team.\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 03  37\\nEQUIPMENT \\n03   SECTION · EQUIPMENT\\n\\n<<<PAGE 23>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nA Player who participates in the play (i.e., checks or prevents the movement of an opponent or who plays the puck) while carrying \\ntwo sticks (including while taking a replacement stick to their goalkeeper) shall incur a minor penalty under this rule.\\nA request for a stick measurement in regular playing time is permitted, including after the scoring of a goal. However, a goal cannot \\nbe disallowed as a result of the measurement.\\nA request for a stick measurement following a goal in overtime (including one scored on a “Penalty Shot” in overtime) is not permit- \\nted. Stick measurements prior to or during the shootout are permitted, subject to the guidelines outlined in\\n ➔ Rule 10.7. – Stick Measurement – Prior to Shootout Attempt.\\nAny Player who deliberately breaks their stick or who refuses to surrender their stick for measurement when requested to do so by \\nthe Referee shall be assessed a minor penalty plus a ten-minute (10) misconduct penalty.\\n10.6. STICK MEASUREMENT – PRIOR TO “PENAL TY SHOT”\\nA stick measurement request may be made prior to a “Penalty Shot” following these guidelines:\\nIf the stick is “legal” the complaining team is assessed a bench minor penalty, and a Player is placed in the penalty box immediately.\\nRegardless of the result of the “Penalty Shot”, the bench minor penalty is assessed and served.\\nIf the stick is “illegal” the Player will be assessed a minor penalty and must proceed to the penalty box immediately to serve their \\npenalty. Another Player must take the “Penalty Shot”. If the Player refuses to surrender their stick for measurement, the “Penalty \\nShot” shall not be permitted, and the Player shall be assessed a misconduct penalty.\\n10.7. STICK MEASUREMENT – PRIOR TO SHOOTOUT ATTEMPT\\nA stick measurement request must be made prior to the Referee blowing his whistle to begin the shootout attempt.\\nIf the stick is “legal” the complaining Team forfeits their next shootout attempt. Their next shootout attempt would be recorded as \\n“no goal”.\\nIf the stick is “illegal”, the offending Team forfeits that shootout attempt by that player, and the player becomes ineligible to partici-\\npate in the shootout. This shootout attempt would be recorded as “no goal”.\\n10.8. ILLEGAL STICK\\nAn illegal stick is defined as one that, following a measurement, is deemed not conforming to Rule 10. An illegal stick is also defined \\nas one when a Player has not been legally handed one by his Players’ bench or from a teammate. And finally, an illegal stick is anyti-\\nme a Player on the ice attempts to play the game with an opponent’s stick.\\nRULE 11 GOALKEEPERS EQUIPMENT\\n11.1.

PENAL TY SHOT\\nA “Penalty Shot” is designed to restore a scoring opportunity which was lost as a result of an infraction being committed by the\\noffending team, based on the parameters set out in these rules.\\n24.2. PROCEDURE\\nThe Referee shall announce the reason for the assessed “Penalty Shot” and shall have the skater selected by the team entitled to \\ntake the “Penalty Shot” announced over the Public Address System. The puck shall then be placed on the center face-off spot and \\nthe Player taking the “Penalty Shot” will, on the instruction of the Referee, by blowing their whistle, play the puck from there and shall \\nattempt to score on the goalkeeper. The puck must be kept in motion towards the opponent’s goal line and once it is shot, the play \\nshall be considered complete. No goal can be scored on a rebound of any kind (an exception being the puck off the goal post or \\ncrossbar, then the goalkeeper and then directly into the goal), and any time the puck crosses the goal line or comes to a complete \\nstop, the “Penalty Shot” shall be considered complete.\\nThe “lacrosse-like move” whereby the puck is picked up on the blade of the stick and “whipped” into the net shall be permitted provi- \\nded the puck is not raised above the height of the shoulders at any time and when released, is not carried higher than the crossbar.\\n ➔ Rule 80.1 – High-sticking the Puck.\\nThe “spin-o-rama type move” where the Player completes a 360° turn as they approach the goal, shall not be permitted. Should a \\nPlayer perform such a move during the “Penalty Shot”, the shot shall be stopped by the Referee and no goal will be the result.\\nOnly a Player designated as a goalkeeper or alternate goalkeeper may defend against a “Penalty Shot”.\\nThe goalkeeper must remain in their crease until the Player taking a “Penalty Shot” has touched the puck.\\nIf at the time a “Penalty Shot” is awarded, the goalkeeper of the penalized team has been removed from the ice to substitute another \\n04   SECTION · TYPES OF PENAL TIES\\n\\n<<<PAGE 39>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 04  54\\nTYPES OF PENAL TIES \\nPlayer, the goalkeeper shall be permitted to return to the ice before the “Penalty Shot” is taken.\\nThe team against whom the “Penalty Shot” has been assessed may replace their goalkeeper to defend against the shot, however, the \\nsubstitute goalkeeper is required to remain in the game until the next stoppage of play.\\nWhile the “Penalty Shot” is being taken, Players of both sides shall withdraw to the sides of the rink and in front of their own Player’s \\nbench.\\n24.3. DESIGNATED PLAYER\\nIn all cases where a “Penalty Shot” has been awarded, the “Penalty Shot” shall be taken by a skater selected by the Coach or Captain \\nof the non-offending team from any non-penalized skater of their team. Such selection shall be reported to the Referee and cannot \\nbe changed.\\n24.4. VIOLATIONS DURING THE “PENAL TY SHOT”\\nShould the goalkeeper leave their crease prior to the Player taking the “Penalty Shot” touching the puck, or committing any infraction, \\nthe Referee shall allow the “Penalty Shot” to be taken. If the “Penalty Shot” fails, the Referee shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be \\ntaken over again. When an infraction worthy of a minor penalty is committed by the goalkeeper during the “Penalty Shot” causing it \\nto fail, no penalty is assessed but the Referee shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be taken over again. Should a goalkeeper commit \\na second (2nd) violation and the “Penalty Shot” fails, they shall be assessed a misconduct penalty and the Referee shall permit the \\n“Penalty Shot” to be taken over again. A third (3rd) such violation shall result in the goalkeeper being assessed a game misconduct \\npenalty and a goal shall be awarded. \\nWhen a major penalty is committed by the goalkeeper that causes the shot to fail, the Referee shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be \\ntaken over again and the appropriate penalties shall be assessed to the goalkeeper.\\nThe goalkeeper may attempt to stop the “Penalty Shot” in any manner except by throwing their stick or any object, deliberately re-\\nmoves their helmet and/or face mask, or by deliberately dislodging the goal, in which case a goal shall be awarded.\\nDuring the “Penalty Shot”, should the goalkeeper, in an attempt at making a save, dislodge the goal accidentally, the Referee shall\\nmake one of the following determinations:\\n(I) Award a goal if they deem the Player would have scored into the area normally occupied by the net had it not been dis -\\nlodged.\\n(II) Allow the “Penalty Shot” to be re-taken if they do not score or it could not be determined if the puck would have entered \\nthe area normally occupied by the net.\\n(III) If the goal becomes dislodged after the puck has crossed the goal line thus ending the “Penalty Shot”, the above de -\\nterminations do not apply, the “Penalty Shot” is complete.\\nIf, while a “Penalty Shot” is being taken, any Player, Coach or team personnel of the opposing team interferes with or distracts the \\nPlayer taking the “Penalty Shot” and, because of such action, the “Penalty Shot” fails, a second (2nd) attempt shall be permitted. \\nThe Referee shall impose a bench minor penalty to the offending team, and if a Player on the bench is responsible, a misconduct \\npenalty on the Player responsible shall be assessed. When a Coach or team personnel is guilty of such an act, a game misconduct \\npenalty shall be assessed on the responsible person and the matter will be reported to the Proper Authorities for possible further \\ndisciplinary action.\\n04   SECTION · TYPES OF PENAL TIES\\n\\n<<<PAGE 40>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 04  55\\nTYPES OF PENAL TIES \\nIf, while the “Penalty Shot” is being taken, any Player, Coach or team personnel of the team taking the “Penalty Shot” interferes with \\nor distracts the goalkeeper defending the “Penalty Shot” and, because of such action, the shot is successful, the Referee shall rule \\nno goal and shall impose a bench minor penalty to the offending team. \\nIf while the “Penalty Shot” is being taken a spectator throws any object onto the ice that in the judgment of the Referee interferes \\nwith the Player taking the “Penalty Shot” or the goalkeeper defending the “Penalty Shot”, they shall permit the “Penalty Shot” to be \\ntaken again. For incidents involving stick measurements refer to:\\n ➔ Rule 10.5 Sticks Measurement and ➔ Rule 10.6 – Sticks Measurement – Prior to Penalty Shot.\\n24.5. FACE-OFF LOCATION\\nIf a goal is scored from a “Penalty Shot”, the puck shall be faced-off at center ice. If a goal is not scored, the puck shall be faced-off \\nat either of the end face-off spots in the zone in which the “Penalty Shot” was attempted, except when another rule dictates the \\n“face-off” location should be in an alternate location, such as when the “point men” enter the zone beyond the outer edge of the end \\nzone face-off circle or when the attacking team has been penalized on the same play.\\n ➔ Rule 76.2 – Face-off Locations. \\n24.6. RESUL TS\\nShould a goal be scored from a “Penalty Shot”, a further penalty to the offending Player shall not be applied unless the offense for \\nwhich the “Penalty Shot” was awarded is a major or misconduct penalty, in which case the appropriate penalty shall be imposed.\\nIf the offense for which the “Penalty Shot” was awarded would normally incur a minor penalty, then regardless of the outcome of the \\n“Penalty Shot”, no further minor penalty shall be served.\\nIf the offense for which the “Penalty Shot” was awarded was to incur a double-minor penalty, or where the offending team is asses-\\nsed an additional minor penalty on the same play, the first minor penalty is not assessed since the “Penalty Shot” was awarded to \\nrestore the lost scoring opportunity. The second minor penalty would be assessed and served regardless of whether the “Penalty \\nShot” results in a goal. This will be announced as a double-minor penalty for the appropriate infraction and the Player will serve two\\n(2) minutes only.\\nNo penalty shall expire when a goal is scored against a team on a “Penalty Shot”.\\nShould two (2) “Penalty Shots” be awarded to the same team at the same stoppage of play (two (2) separate infractions), only one\\n(1) goal can be scored or awarded at a single stoppage of play. Should the first “Penalty Shot” result in a goal, the second “Penalty \\nShot” would not be taken but the appropriate penalty would be assessed and served for the infraction committed.\\n24.7. TIMING\\nIf the infraction upon which the “Penalty Shot” is based occurs during actual playing time, the “Penalty Shot” shall be awarded and \\ntaken immediately in the usual manner notwithstanding any delay occasioned by a slow whistle by the Referee to allow play to con- \\ntinue until the attacking side has lost possession of the puck to the defending side, to which this delay results in the expiry of the \\nregular playing time in any period.\\nThe time required for the taking of a “Penalty Shot” shall not be included in the regular playing time or overtime.\\n04   SECTION · TYPES OF PENAL TIES\\n\\n<<<PAGE 41>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 04  56\\nTYPES OF PENAL TIES \\n24.8. INFRACTIONS\\nWhen a Player, in the neutral or attacking zone, in “control” of the puck (or who could have obtained “possession and control” of \\nthe puck) and having no other opponent to pass than the goalkeeper, is fouled from behind, thus preventing a reasonable scoring \\nopportunity, a “Penalty Shot” shall be awarded to the non-offending team.\\nNevertheless, the Referee shall not stop play until the attacking team has “lost possession” of the puck to the defending team. \\nThe intention of this rule is to restore a reasonable “scoring opportunity” which has been lost. If, however, the Player fouled is able to \\nrecover and obtain a “reasonable scoring opportunity” (or a teammate is able to gain a reasonable scoring opportunity), no “Penalty \\nShot” should be awarded but the appropriate penalty should be signaled and assessed if a goal is not scored on the play. “Control of \\nthe puck” means the act of propelling the puck with the stick, hand, or feet.\\nIn order for a “Penalty Shot” to be awarded for a Player being fouled from behind, the following four (4) criteria must have been met:\\n(I) The infraction must have taken place in the neutral or attacking zone (i.e., over the puck carrier’s own blue line);\\n(II) The infraction must have been committed from behind (except a foul committed from the front by the goalkeeper on a \\n“breakaway” situation);\\n(III) (The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained pos -\\nsession and control” of the puck) must have been denied a reasonable chance to score. The fact that the Player got a \\nshot off does not automatically eliminate this play from the “Penalty Shot” consideration criteria. If the infraction was \\nfrom behind and the Player was denied a “more reasonable scoring opportunity” due to the infraction, then the “Penalty \\nShot” should still be awarded;\\n(IV) The Player in “possession and control” (or, in the judgment of the Referee, the Player clearly would have “obtained pos -\\nsession and control”) must have had no opposing Player between themself and the goalkeeper.\\nIf, in the opinion of the Referee, a Player makes contact with the puck first and subsequently trips the opponent in so doing, no “Pe-\\nnalty Shot” will be awarded, but a Minor Penalty for “tripping” shall be assessed.\\nIt should be noted that if the attacking Player manages to get around the goalkeeper and has no defending Player between them and \\nthe “open goal”, and they are fouled from behind by the goalkeeper or another defending Player, no goal can be awarded since the \\ngoalkeeper is still on the ice. A “Penalty Shot” would be awarded.\\n ➔ For a list of the infractions that shall result in a penalty shot being awarded refer to Appendix IV – Tables Overview – Table 11.\\nRULE 25  AWARDED GOALS\\n25.1. AWARDED GOAL\\nA goal will be awarded to the attacking team when the opposing team has taken their goalkeeper off the ice and an attacking Player \\nhas “possession and control of the puck” (or “would have gained possession and control”) in the neutral or attacking zone, without \\na defending Player between themself and the opposing goal, and they are “prevented from scoring” as a result of an infraction com-\\nmitted by the defending team.\\n ➔ Rule 25.3 – Infractions when Goalkeeper is Off the Ice.\\n \\n25.2.

The third \\n(3rd) penalized Player must proceed at once to the penalty box and must be substituted on the ice to keep the “on-ice strength” at \\nno less than three (3) skaters for the team.\\nWhen the penalties of two (2) Players of the same team will expire at the same time, the Captain of that team will designate to the \\nReferee which Player will return to the ice first and the Referee will instruct the Penalty Timekeeper accordingly (this is done to ex -\\npedite the release of a Player from the penalty box when the opposing team scores on the “Power-Play”).\\n26.2. PENAL TY EXPIRATION\\nWhen any team has three (3) Players serving penalties at the same time and because of the delayed penalty rule, a substitute for \\nthe third (3rd) offender is on the ice, none of the three (3) penalized Players in the penalty box may return to the ice until play has \\nstopped.\\nWhen play has been stopped, the Player whose penalty has fully expired may return to the ice. During the play, the Penalty Timekee-\\nper shall permit the penalized Players to return to the ice, in the order of expiration of their penalties, but only when the penalized \\nteam is entitled to have more than four (4) Players on the ice. Otherwise, these Players must wait until the first stoppage of play after \\nthe expiration of their penalties in order to be released from the penalty box.\\n04   SECTION · TYPES OF PENAL TIES\\n\\n<<<PAGE 43>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 04  58\\nTYPES OF PENAL TIES\\n26.3.

MINOR PENAL TY TO GOALKEEPER\\nA goalkeeper shall not be sent to the penalty box for an offense which incurs a minor penalty, but instead, the minor penalty shall \\nbe served by another member of their team who was on the ice when play is stopped and the penalty assessed. This Player is to be \\ndesignated by the Coach of the offending team through the playing Captain and such substitute shall not be changed.\\nA penalized Player may not serve a goalkeeper’s penalty.\\nIf the goalkeeper is involved in coincidental penalties being assessed and as a result, their team is required to play “short-handed” \\ndue to additional penalties assessed to the goalkeeper, the Player designated to serve the additional time penalties assessed to the \\ngoalkeeper may be any Player as designated by the Coach of the offending team through the Captain.\\n27.2. MAJOR PENAL TY TO GOALKEEPER\\nA goalkeeper shall not be sent to the penalty box for an offense which incurs a major penalty, but instead, the major penalty shall be \\nserved immediately by another member of their team who was on the ice when play is stopped and the penalty assessed.

Should a goalkeeper incur two (2) major penalties in one game (results an automatic game misconduct penalty), they shall be \\nruled off the ice for the balance of the game and their place shall be taken by a member of their own team, or by a regular substitute \\ngoalkeeper who is available. This Player will be allowed the goalkeeper’s full equipment.\\n27.3. MISCONDUCT PENAL TY TO GOALKEEPER\\nShould a goalkeeper on the ice incur a misconduct penalty, this penalty shall be served by another member of their team who was\\non the ice when play is stopped and the penalty assessed.

GOAL SITUATIONS SUBJECT TO VIDEO REVIEW\\nThe following situations are subject to Video Review:\\n(I) Puck crossing the goal line\\n(II) Puck in the net prior to the goal frame being dislodged or if the criteria’s for allowing a goal after a dislodged net is met.\\n(III) Puck in the net prior to (or after) the expiration of time at the end of a period\\n(IV) With the use of a foot/skate, a “distinct kicking motion” was evident\\n(V) Puck deliberately directed, batted, or thrown into the net by an attacking Player by any means (and with any part of their \\nbody) other than with their stick – excl. foot/skate – see (IV) above.\\n(VI) Puck deflected directly into the net of an on-ice Official\\n(VII) Puck struck or deflected into the net with a high stick, above the height of the crossbar\\n(VIII) Puck entering the net in a proper manner through goal mouth (ensuring puck did not enter net improperly through net \\nmeshing or underneath the net frame, etc.)\\n(IX) Puck entering the net as the culmination of a continuous play where the result of the play was unaffected by any whistle \\nblown by the Referee upon their losing sight of the puck; and\\n(X) The legitimacy of all potential goals on “Penalty Shot” or Shootout attempts to ensure compliance with applicable rules \\n(e.g. goalkeeper leaving crease prior to puck touch at center ice, goalkeeper throwing stick, goalkeeper dislodging goal, \\nshooter cradling puck above the normal height of the shoulders, shooter performing illegal “spin-o-rama” move, skater’s \\ncontinued forward advancement of puck, “double-tap”/ “rebound”, etc.)\\nCoach\\'s Challenge according to Rule 38 – Coach’s Challenge will only be used at selected IIHF Championships.

DISTINCT KICKING MOTION\\nPlays that involve a puck entering the net as a direct result of a “distinct kicking motion” shall be ruled “no goal”. A “distinct kicking \\nmotion,” for purposes of video review, is one where the video makes clear that an attacking Player has deliberately propelled the puck \\nwith a kick of their foot or skate and the puck subsequently enters the net. A goal cannot be scored on a play where an attacking \\nPlayer propels the puck with their skate into the net (even by means of a subsequent deflection off another Player, unless from a \\nstick of a skater) using a “distinct kicking motion”.\\nA goal also cannot be scored on a play where an attacking Player kicks any equipment (stick, glove, helmet, etc.) at the puck, inclu-\\nding kicking the blade of their own stick, causing the puck to cross the goal line.\\nA puck that deflects into the net off an attacking Player’s skate who does not use a “distinct kicking motion” shall be ruled  \\na “good goal”.\\nA puck that is directed into the net by an attacking Players’ skate shall also be ruled a “good goal”, as long as no “distinct kicking \\nmotion” is evident.\\n ➔ Rule 49.2. – Kicking / Goals.\\n37.5. PUCK STRUCK WITH A HIGH STICK\\nThe determining factor for high stick video review is where the puck makes contact with the stick in relation to the crossbar.\\nIf the puck makes contact with a portion of the stick that is at or below the level of the crossbar (despite some other portion of the \\nstick being above the crossbar) and enters the goal, the goal shall be allowed.\\n ➔ Rule 80.3. – High-sticking the Puck.\\n37.6. VIDEO REVIEW TO VERIFY TIME ON CLOCK\\nVideo review may be used to establish the correct time on the clock.\\nAny loss of time on the game or penalty clocks due to a false “face-off”, a “face-off” violation or a puck going out of play must be \\nreplaced. The Video Review Consultant may be consulted or may intervene with On- and Off-Ice Officials directly, as appropriate, to \\nensure that any loss of time on the game or penalty clocks due to these situations is properly replaced. \\n ➔ Rule 76.8 – Face-off Procedure / Verification of Time, ➔ Rule 85.7 – Puck Out of Bounds / Verification of Time.\\nIn the event of any dispute regarding time, the matter shall be referred to the Video Review Consultant for adjustment, and its deci-\\nsion shall be final. The Game Timekeeper shall assist to verify game time via an additional timing device (IIHF-approved stopwatch). \\nIn the event a video review shows that a goal was scored prior to the play being stopped, the Video Review Consultant will inform \\nthe Game Timekeeper and Official Scorekeeper of the time of the goal and the amount of playing time left to be re-set on the Game \\nClock and penalty time clocks (if applicable).\\n ➔ Rule 34.7 – Game Timekeeper / Verification of Time.\\n05   SECTION · OFFICIALS\\n\\n<<<PAGE 59>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 05  74\\nOFFICIALS\\n37.7. GOAL JUDGE BEHIND THE NETS – NO VIDEO REVIEW AVAILABLE\\nIn IIHF Championships where Video Review is not used, Goal Judges behind both nets shall be used.\\nThere shall be one Goal Judge situated behind each goal (or in an area designated and approved by the IIHF), in properly protected \\nareas, if possible, so that there can be no interference with their activities. They shall not change goals during the game.\\nThe Goal Judge shall signal, normally by means of red light, a decision as to whether the puck passed between the goal posts and \\nentirely over the goal line.\\nThe only decision the Goal Judge must make is whether the puck actually entered the net, not how or when it went in.\\nThe light must be illuminated for a period of five (5) seconds each time the puck enters the net regardless of circumstances.  \\nIt is up to the Referee to make the final decision.\\n »For more information refer to IIHF Technology Codes & Regulations.\\nRULE 38  COACH’S CHALLENGE\\n38.1. GENERAL\\nThe video review mechanism triggered by the Coach’s Challenge can only be utilized in goal / no goal and delay of game – puck over \\nglass situations (Rule 63.2 III) and is intended to be extremely narrow in scope. In all Coach’s Challenge situations, the original call on \\nthe ice will be overturned if, and only if, a conclusive and irrefutable determination can be made on the basis of video evidence that \\nthe original call on the ice was clearly not correct. If a review is not conclusive and/or there is any doubt whatsoever as to whether \\nthe call on the ice was correct, the original call on the ice will be confirmed.\\n »For more information refer to IIHF Technology Codes & Regulations.\\n38.2. SITUATIONS SUBJECT TO COACH’S CHALLENGE\\nA team may only request a Coach’s Challenge to review the following scenarios:\\n(I) “Off-side”- Play Leading to a goal\\nA play that results in a “goal” call on the ice where the defending team claims that the play should have been stopped by \\nreason of an “Off-side” infraction by the attacking team.\\n ➔ Rule 83 – Off-side.\\n \\n(II) Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Attacking Zone Leading to a Goal\\nA play that results in a “goal” call on the ice where the defending team claims that the play should have been stopped by \\nreason of any play occurring in the attacking zone that should have resulted in a play stoppage caused by the attacking \\nteam but did not. The one exception to this provision is when the puck is played out from the playing area by either team \\nand goes unnoticed by the On-Ice Officials;\\n(III) Scoring Plays Involving Potential “Interference on the Goalkeeper”\\n Either: \\n(1) A play that results in a “goal” call on the ice where the defending team claims that the goal should have been disal-\\nlowed due to “Interference on the Goalkeeper” ➔ Rule 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper; or\\n(2)  A play that results in a “no goal” call on the ice despite the puck having entered the net, where the On-Ice Officials \\n05   SECTION · OFFICIALS\\n\\n<<<PAGE 60>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 05  75\\nOFFICIALS\\nhave determined that the attacking team was guilty of “Interference on the Goalkeeper” but where the attacking \\nteam claims:\\n•  There was no actual contact of any kind initiated by an attacking Player with the goalkeeper;\\n• The attacking Player was pushed, shoved or fouled by a defending Player which caused the attacking Player to \\ncome into contact with the goalkeeper; or\\n• The attacking Player’s positioning within the goal crease did not impair the goalkeeper’s ability to defend their \\ngoal and, in fact, had no discernable impact on the play.\\n(IV) Penalty situations for “Delaying the game – puck over the glass”\\nWhen a minor penalty for delaying the game has been assessed under Rule 63.2 (III) for shooting or batting the puck out \\nof play from the defending zone. This will only apply to delay of game penalties when the shot/batted puck is determined \\nto have subsequently deflected off a player, stick, glass or boards, etc., and not a judgment call. No challenge can be \\nissued for a non-call, in other words, no challenge is to be considered when the On-Ice Officials deem that it was not a \\nviolation of Rule 63.2 (III). A challenge can only be used to nullify a penalty, not to have one assessed. In the event of a \\nfailed challenge, an additional minor penalty (or double-minor penalty, as appropriate) will be assessed (in addition to the \\nexisting delay of game penalty). \\n ➔ Rule 63 - Delaying the game\\n38.3. PROCESS FOR INITIATING A COACH’S CHALLENGE\\nAll Coach’s Challenges must be initiated by notice verbally communicated to a Referee prior to the center ice “face-off” following a \\n“goal” or, in the case of a “no goal” call by reason of “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” or in the case of a minor penalty for delaying \\nthe game – puck over glass, prior to the resumption of play.\\nTeams may not unduly delay the resumption of play while evaluating whether or not to initiate a Coach’s Challenge. Any such delay \\nor delay tactics may result in the denial of a right to Challenge and, at the discretion of the Referee, may also result in a bench minor \\npenalty for “Delaying the Game”.\\n ➔ Rule 63 – Delaying the Game.\\nIn order to expedite the review process, Coaches initiating a Coach’s Challenge are required to provide to the Referee, with reasona-\\nble specificity, both the reason for their Coach’s Challenge (i.e., the actual infraction that is being claimed) and the approximate time \\non the clock when the purported infraction transpired. Failure to provide this information with reasonable specificity may result in \\nthe denial of a right to a Coach’s Challenge.\\nOnly one Coach’s Challenge per team per stoppage will be permitted.\\n38.4. PROCESS FOR REVIEWING A COACH’S CHALLENGE\\nThe IIHF Technology Department in cooperation with the Organizer will make available in all arenas suitable technology (for exam- \\nple, a handheld tablet or a television or computer monitor) that will allow the On-Ice Officials, in conjunction with the Video Review \\nConsultant, to review video replays of the play giving rise to the Coach’s Challenge. To the extent practical and possible, the replays \\nmade available to the On-Ice Officials will be the same replays that are being utilized by the Video Review Consultant.\\nOnce a Coach’s Challenge has been initiated, the Video Review Consultant will immediately establish contact with the On-Ice Offi- \\ncial(s) responsible for the call (or non-call) on the ice via the headset and will inquire and discuss with the On-Ice Official(s), prior to \\nthe On-Ice Official reviewing any video, the following:\\n05   SECTION · OFFICIALS\\n\\n<<<PAGE 61>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 05  76\\nOFFICIALS\\n(I)  the On-Ice Official’s “final call on the ice”; and\\n(II) what the On-Ice Official(s) observed on the play.\\nThe Video Review Consultant will be involved both in communicating with the On-Ice Officials via the headset and with providing \\ninput to the On-Ice Officials. The On-Ice Officials are responsible for making the “final” decision.\\nThe “on-ice call” will then be reviewed simultaneously by the appropriate On-Ice Official(s) at ice level and by the Video Review\\nConsultant using any and all replays at their disposal.\\nAfter their joint review and consultation, the On-Ice Officials will render the decision on whether to uphold\\nor overturn the original “call on the ice”.\\nOnce a decision is made, the Referee will inform the Penalty Timekeeper/Public Address Announcer and will make the announce- \\nment on the ice.\\n38.5. RIGHT TO INITIATE A COACH’S CHALLENGE\\nTeams may initiate a Coach’s Challenge on appropriate plays at any time during the game.\\n38.6. RESUL TS OF A SUCCESSFUL COACH’S CHALLENGE\\nIn cases where a Challenge has been initiated for an “Off-side Play Leading to a Goal” or a “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the \\nOffensive Zone Leading to a Goal”, and a determination is made that the GOAL call on the ice should be overturned, the goal will be \\ndisallowed and the clock will be re-set to the time at which the play should have been stopped for the missed infraction.\\nIn such cases, a “face-off” will ensue in the ice location where it would have otherwise occurred had the on-ice infraction been called \\nproperly. If one or more penalties (minor or major) are assessed between the time of the missed infraction and the video review \\nthat disallows the apparent goal, the offending team(s) (and responsible Player(s)) will still be required to serve the penalty(ies) \\nidentified and assessed, and the time of the penalty(ies) will be recorded as the time at which the play should have been stopped \\nfor the missed infraction.\\nIn cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “goal” call on the ice where the defending team claims that the goal should have \\nbeen disallowed due to the “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” as described in ➔ Rules 69 – Interference on the Goalkeeper, and \\na determination is made that the “call on the ice” should be overturned, the goal will be disallowed, and a “face-off” will ensue in the \\nnearest neutral zone face-off spot outside the attacking zone.\\nThe video review process on these plays will be utilized exclusively for purposes of overturning a “goal” call on the ice – it will not\\nbe utilized for any other purpose, including, specifically, for assessing minor or major penalties for Goalkeeper Interference.\\nIn cases where a Challenge has been initiated for a “no goal” call on the ice despite the puck having entered the net, where the On-Ice \\nOfficials have determined that the attacking team was guilty of “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” and a determination is made that \\nthe “call on the ice” should be overturned, the goal will be allowed an a “face-off” will ensue at center ice.\\n ➔ Rule 69 – \"Interference on a goalkeeper\"\\nIf a penalty for “Interference on a Goalkeeper” was indicated and based on the video review, no such action was committed by the \\nattacking Player, no penalty shall be assessed for such an infraction.\\nAll other penalties not related to “Interference on a Goalkeeper” should be assessed and served in a normal manner. On the other \\n05   SECTION · OFFICIALS\\n\\n<<<PAGE 62>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 05  77\\nOFFICIALS\\nhand, penalties not indicated cannot be assessed as a result of the video review.\\n38.7. RESUL TS OF AN UNSUCCESSFUL COACH’S CHALLENGE\\nIf a team initiates a Coach’s Challenge for any of the enumerated scenarios in Rule 38.2 above and such challenge does not result \\nin the “final call on the ice” being overturned, the team exercising such challenge shall be assessed a bench minor penalty (2 minu -\\ntes) for Delaying the Game. If a team that has already initiated one or more Coach’s Challenges that were unsuccessful, initiates a \\nCoach’s Challenge for any of the enumerated scenarios in Rule 38.2 above and such challenge does not result in the original call on \\nthe ice being overturned, the team exercising the Coach’s Challenge shall be assessed a double-bench minor penalty (4 minutes) \\nfor Delaying the Game.\\nNote: If a situation cannot be reviewed by the On-Ice Officials due to a technical error (e.g. a \"black screen\"), the \"final call on the ice\" \\nwill stand. In this case, the Coach\\'s Challenge will be considered “unsuccessful” but no bench minor penalty will be assessed on the \\nteam that initiated the challenge.\\n38.8. APPLICABLE STANDARDS FOR “OFF-SIDE” CHALLENGE\\nThe standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-Ice Officials (Linespersons), after revie- wing \\nany and all available replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant, determine that one or more Players on the attacking \\nteam preceded the puck into the attacking zone prior to the goal being scored and that, as a result, the play should have been stop-\\nped for an “Off-side” infraction; where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed.\\nGoals will only be subject to review for a potential “Off-side” infraction if the puck does not come out of the attacking zone again \\nbetween the time of the “Off-side” infraction and the time the goal is scored.\\n38.9. APPLICABLE STANDARDS FOR “MISSED GAME STOPPAGE EVENT IN THE ATTACKING ZONE” \\nCHALLENGE\\nThe standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-Ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing any \\nand all available replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant determine that the play should have been stopped for an \\nevent caused by the attacking team, but was not at some point after the puck entered the attacking zone but prior to the goal being \\nscored; where this standard is met, the goal will be disallowed.\\nPotential infractions that would require a play stoppage in the attacking zone by the attacking team include, but may not be limited \\nto:  ➔ Rule 79 – Hand Pass; ➔ Rule 80 – High-sticking the Puck; and ➔ Rule 85 – Puck Out of Bounds. Such infractions will only \\nserve as a basis for overturning a “goal” call on the ice if video review can conclusively establish that a game stoppage event had \\noccurred in the attacking zone and was missed by the On-Ice Official(s).\\nWhere the infraction at issue was a missed penalty call subject to the judgment or discretion of the On-Ice Official(s), such infraction \\ncannot result in the “goal” call on the ice being overturned, even if upon review, the On-Ice Official(s) would have made a different call. \\nGoals will only be reviewed for a potential “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Attacking Zone” if the puck does not come out of the \\nattacking zone again between the time of the “Missed Game Stoppage Event in the Attacking Zone” and the time the goal is scored.\\n38.10. APPLICABLE STANDARDS FOR POTENTIAL “INTERFERENCE ON THE GOALKEEPER” CHALLENGE\\nThe standard for overturning the call in the event of a “goal” call on the ice is that the On-Ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing \\nany and all replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant, determine that the goal should have been disallowed due \\nto “Interference on the Goalkeeper,” as described in ➔ Rule 69  – Interference on the Goalkeeper;  where this standard is met,  \\n05   SECTION · OFFICIALS\\n\\n<<<PAGE 63>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 05  78\\nOFFICIALS\\nthe goal will be disallowed.\\nThe standard for overturning the call in the event of a “no goal” call on the ice is that the On-Ice Officials (Referees), after reviewing \\nany and all replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant, determine that the goal on the ice should have been allowed \\nbecause either:\\n(I) There was no actual contact of any kind initiated by the attacking Player with the goalkeeper; or\\n(II) The attacking Player was pushed, shoved or fouled by the defending Player causing the attacking Player to come into \\ncontact with the goalkeeper; or \\n(III) The attacking Player’s positioning within the Goal Crease did not impair the goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal and, \\nin fact, had no discernable impact on the play; where this standard is met, the goal will be allowed.\\n38.11. APPLICABLE STANDARDS FOR “DELAYING THA GAME – PUCK OVER GLASS” CHALLENGE\\nThe standard for overturning a minor penalty for delaying the game – puck over glass call to a defending player is that the On-Ice \\nOfficials (Referees), after reviewing any and all replays and consulting with the Video Review Consultant, determines that the puck \\nwas deflected or rebounded off the boards, glass, goal net frame or otherwise, or did not break the plane of the glass directed up -\\nwards, and should not be subject to a minor penalty. In such cases, the minor penalty is rescinded, and a face-off conducted in the \\ndefending zone.\\nRULE 39  ABUSE OF OFFICIALS\\n39.1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION\\nA Player, Coach or team personnel shall not challenge or dispute the rulings of an Official before, during or after a game, on  \\nor off the ice and any location while in the arena and its connected premises.\\nA Player, Coach or team personnel shall not display “Unsportsmanlike Conduct” including, but not limited to, obscene, profane or \\nabusive language or gestures, comments of a personal nature intended to degrade an Official or persist in disputing a ruling after \\nbeing told to stop or after being penalized for such behavior.

The severity of the penalty, based upon the impact with the boards, \\nshall be at the discretion of the Referee.\\nThere is a considerable amount of judgment involved in the application of this rule by the Referees. The responsibility is on the Player \\napplying the check to ensure their opponent is not in a defenseless position and if so, they must avoid or minimize contact. However, \\nin determining whether such contact could have been avoided, the circumstances of the check, including whether the opponent put \\nthemself in a vulnerable position immediately prior to or simultaneously with the check or whether the check was unavoidable can \\nbe considered. This balance must be considered by the Referees when applying this rule.\\nAny unnecessary contact with a Player playing the puck on an obvious “icing” or “off-side” play which results in that Player hitting or \\nimpacting the boards is “boarding” and must be penalized as such.

INTERFERENCE\\nA Player who obstructs or prevents an opponent “without possession of the puck” from skating, receiving a pass, or moving about \\nthe ice freely is considered as “interference”.\\nA “late-hit” constitutes reckless endangerment of a Player who “no longer has control or possession of the puck”.\\nAny Player who is in the process of “abandoning” or “losing control or possession of the puck” is subject to a bodycheck so long  \\nas the aggressor is in the immediate vicinity of the skater with the puck.\\nA strict standard on acts of interference must be adhered to in all areas of the rink.\\nBody Position:    “Body position” shall be determined as the Player skating in front of or beside their opponent,  \\n     traveling in the same direction. A Player who is behind an opponent, who does not have the puck,  \\n     may not use their stick, body, or free hand in order to restrain their opponent, but must skate in order  \\n     to gain or reestablish their “proper position” in order to make a check. \\n     A Player is allowed the ice they are standing on (body position) and are not required to move in order  \\n     to let an opponent proceed. A Player may “block the path” of an opponent provided they are in front \\n     of their opponent and moving in the same direction. Moving laterally and without “establishing body  \\n     position”, then making contact with the non-puck carrier is not permitted and will be penalized as \\n     “interference”. A Player is always entitled to use their “body position” to lengthen an opponent’s path \\n     to the puck, provided their stick is not utilized (to make themself “bigger” and therefore considerably  \\n     lengthening the distance their opponent must travel to get where they are going); their “free hand”  \\n     is not used, and they do not take advantage of their “body position” to deliver an otherwise illegal  \\n     check.\\nPossession of the Puck:  The last Player to touch the puck, other than the goalkeeper, shall be considered the Player in “possession”.  \\n     The Player deemed in “possession” of the puck may be checked legally, provided the check is rendered \\n     immediately following them “loss of control” and their opponent still finds themself within  \\n     an “objectively reasonable window of opportunity” to deliver such a check refer to Rule 56.4  –  \\n     Interference . \\n07   SECTION · RESTRAINING INFRACTIONS\\n\\n<<<PAGE 85>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 07  100\\nRESTRAINING INFRACTIONS\\nRestrain:      The actions of a Player who does not have “body position”, but instead uses illegal means (e.g.,  \\n     “hook” with stick; “hold” with hands, “trip” with the stick or in any manner) to impede an opponent who is not  \\n     in “possession” of the puck. Illegal means are acts which allow a Player to “establish,  maintain or restore \\n     body position” other than by skating.\\nPick:     A “pick” is the action of a Player who checks an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck and is  \\n     unaware of the impending check/hit.\\n     A Player who is aware of an impending hit, not deemed to be a legal “battle for the puck,” may not be  \\n     interfered with by a Player delivering a “pick.”\\n     A Player delivering a “pick” is one who moves into an opponent’s path without initially having “body  \\n      position”, thereby taking them “out of the play”. When this is done, an “interference” penalty shall be  \\n     assessed.\\nFree Hand:    When a “free hand” is used to hold, pull, tug, grab or physically restrain an opponent from moving  \\n     “freely”, this must be penalized as “holding”. The “free hand” may be used by a Player to “fend off” an  \\n     opponent or their stick but may not be used to hold an opponent’s stick or body.\\nStick:     A Player who does not have “body position” on their opponent, who uses their stick (either the blade or  \\n     the shaft, including the butt-end of the shaft) to impede or prevent their opponent from moving “freely”  \\n     on the ice shall be assessed a “hooking” penalty.\\n ➔ Rule 55 – Hooking. \\n56.2. MINOR PENAL TY\\nA minor penalty for “interference” shall be assessed:\\n(I) On a Player who interferes with or impedes the progress of an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck;\\n(II) On a Player who restrains an opponent who is attempting to “fore-check”; \\n(III) On any Player who deliberately checks an opponent, including the goalkeeper, who is “not or no longer deemed in  \\npossession” of the puck (“late-hit”);\\n(IV) On a Player who shall cause an opponent who is not in “possession” of the puck to be forced off-side, causing a stoppage \\nin play. If this action causes a delayed off-side (and not necessarily a stoppage in play), then the application of a penalty \\nfor “interference” is subject to the judgment of the Referee;\\n(V) On a Player who deliberately “knocks” the stick out of an opponent’s hand or prevents a Player who has dropped their \\nstick or any other piece of equipment from regaining “possession” of it,\\n(VI) On a Player who “knocks or shoots” any abandoned or broken stick or illegal puck or other debris towards an opposing  \\npuck carrier in a manner that could cause them to be distracted; \\n ➔ Rule 53 – Throwing Equipment.;\\n(VII) On any identifiable Player on the Players’ bench or penalty box who, by means of their stick or their body, interferes with \\nthe movements of the puck or any opponent on the ice during the progress of the play;\\n07   SECTION · RESTRAINING INFRACTIONS\\n\\n<<<PAGE 86>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 07  101\\nRESTRAINING INFRACTIONS\\n(VIII) On any Player about to come onto the ice who plays the puck while one or both skates are still on the Players’ bench or \\npenalty box. \\nThe appropriate penalty according to the playing rules shall be assessed when a Player on the Players’ bench or penalty box gets \\ninvolved with an opponent on the ice during a stoppage in play. The Player(s) involved may be subject to additional sanctions as \\nappropriate.\\n ➔ Rule 28 – Supplementary Discipline.\\n56.3. BENCH MINOR PENAL TY\\nA bench minor penalty shall be assessed when an unidentifiable Player on the Players’ bench or penalty box or any Coach or team \\npersonnel who, by means of their stick or their body, interferes with the movements of the puck or any opponent on the ice during \\nthe progress of the play.\\n56.4. MAJOR PENAL TY\\nThe Referee, at their discretion, may assess a major penalty to a Player guilty of “interference” on an opponent, and who recklessly \\nendangers the fouled Player in a way that at the discretion of the Referee such Player would not be sufficiently sanctioned by im- \\nposing a minor penalty.\\n56.5.

BENCH MINOR PENAL TY\\nA bench minor penalty shall be imposed upon any team which, after warning by the Referee to its Captain or Alternate Captain to \\nplace the correct number of Players on the ice and commence play, fails to comply with the Referee’s direction and thereby causes \\nany delay by making additional substitutions (including, but not limited to, continually substituting goalkeepers for the purpose of \\nstalling or delaying the game), by persisting in having its Players off-side, or in any other manner.\\n63.4. DELAYED WHISTLE\\nWhen the net is accidentally displaced by an attacking Player, and the defending side is in control of the puck and moving out of their \\nzone, play shall be permitted to continue until such time as the non-offending team loses control of the puck.\\nThe resulting “face-off” will take place at a face-off spot in the zone nearest the location where the play was stopped, unless it is in \\nthe non-offending team’s defending zone, and as such the ensuing “face-off” would be outside the blue line at one of the face-off \\nspots in the neutral zone.\\nIt is possible for a goal to be scored at one end of the rink, while the net at the other end has been dislodged, provided that the team \\nbeing scored upon is the team responsible for dislodging the net at the other end of the rink.\\n63.5. OBJECTS THROWN ON THE ICE\\nIn the event that objects are thrown on the ice that interfere with the progress of the game, the Referee shall blow the whistle and \\nstop the play and the puck shall be faced-off at a face-off spot in the zone nearest to the spot where play is stopped.\\n63.6. PENAL TY SHOT\\nIf by reason of insufficient time in the regular playing time or by reason of penalties already imposed, the minor penalty assessed to \\na Player for deliberately displacing their own goal post cannot be served in its entirety within the regular playing time of the game or \\nat any time in overtime, a “Penalty Shot” shall be awarded against the offending team.\\nNo defending Player, except the goalkeeper, will be permitted to fall on the puck, hold the puck, pick up the puck, or gather the puck \\ninto the body or hands when the puck is within the goal crease. For infringement of this rule, play shall immediately be stopped and \\na “Penalty Shot” shall be ordered against the offending team, but no other penalty shall be given. The rule shall be interpreted so \\nthat a “Penalty Shot” will be awarded only when the puck is in the goal crease at the instant the offense occurs. However, in cases \\nwhere the puck is outside the goal crease, Rule 63 may still apply and a minor penalty may be imposed, even though no “Penalty \\nShot” is awarded. The significant factor when determining whether or not a “Penalty Shot” is warranted is the location of the puck \\nat the time it was held, grabbed or gathered into the body. If the puck is in the goal crease, a “Penalty Shot” shall be awarded. If the \\npuck is outside the goal crease and gathered into the body of a Player (other than the goalkeeper) who is inside the goal crease, a \\nminor penalty shall be assessed.\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 09  111\\nOTHER INFRACTIONS\\n09   SECTION · OTHER INFRACTIONS\\n\\n<<<PAGE 97>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n63.7.

NO LINE CHANGE\\nIn the event the goal post is displaced accidentally by a defending Player causing a stoppage in play, the ensuing “face-off” shall \\nbe conducted at one of the end zone face-off spots in the defending zone. The offending team shall not be permitted to make any \\nPlayer substitutions prior to the “face-off”.

The defending team shall not be permitted to make any Player substitutions prior to the \\n“face-off”. However, a team shall be permitted to make a Player substitution to replace an injured Player, or when a penalty has been \\nassessed which affects the “on-ice strength” of either team.\\nIn addition, for both situations outlined in this section, for the ensuing “face-off” in the defending zone, the attacking team will have\\nthe choice of which end zone face-off spot the “face-off” will take place.\\nRULE 64  DIVING / EMBELLISHMENT\\n64.1.

INTERFERENCE ON THE GOALKEEPER\\nThis rule is based on the premise that an attacking Player’s position, whether inside or outside the goal crease, should not, by itself, \\ndetermine whether a goal should be allowed or disallowed. In other words, goals scored while attacking Players are standing in the \\ngoal crease may, in appropriate circumstances be allowed. Goals should be disallowed only if:\\n(I) an attacking Player, either by their positioning or by a \"relevant contact”, impairs the goalkeeper’s ability to move freely \\nwithin their goal crease or defend their goal; or\\n(II) an attacking Player initiates intentional or deliberate contact with a goalkeeper, inside or outside of their goal crease.\\n“Incidental contact” with a goalkeeper will be permitted, and resulting goals allowed, when such contact is initiated outside of the \\ngoal crease, provided the attacking Player has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact.\\nThe rule will be enforced exclusively in accordance with the on-ice judgement of the Referee(s), but may be subject to a Video  \\nReview: ➔ Rule 37 – Video Review,  when applicable or to a Coach’s Challenge ➔ Rule 38 – Coach’s Challenge.\\nFor purposes of this rule, “contact / relevant contact” whether \"incidental or otherwise\", shall mean any contact that is made between \\nor among a goalkeeper and attacking Player(s), whether by means of a stick or any part of the body. The overriding rationale of this \\nrule is that a goalkeeper should have the ability to move freely within their goal crease without being hindered by the actions of an \\nattacking Player.\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 09  116\\nOTHER INFRACTIONS\\n09   SECTION · OTHER INFRACTIONS\\n\\n<<<PAGE 102>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nIf an attacking Player enters the goal crease and, by their actions, impairs the goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal, and a goal is \\nscored, the goal will be disallowed.\\nIf an attacking Player is in the goal crease and does not leave immediately, the Referee has the possibility to stop the game and the \\nsubsequent “face-off” shall take place at the nearest neutral zone face-off spot outside the attacking zone of the offending team. \\nIf an attacking Player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by a defending Player so as to cause them to come into contact with the \\ngoalkeeper, such contact will not be deemed contact initiated by the attacking Player for purposes of this rule, provided the attacking \\nPlayer has made a reasonable effort to avoid such contact.\\nIf a defending Player has been pushed, shoved, or fouled by an attacking Player so as to cause the defending Player to come  \\ninto contact with their own goalkeeper, such contact shall be deemed contact initiated by the attacking Player for purposes of  \\nthis rule, and if necessary, a penalty assessed to the attacking Player and if a goal is scored it would be disallowed.\\n ➔ For more information refer to Appendix IV – Table 16 – Interference on the Goalkeeper Situations. \\n69.2. PENAL TY\\nIn all cases in which an attacking Player initiates “intentional or deliberate” contact with a goalkeeper, whether or not the goalkeeper \\nis inside or outside the goal crease, and whether or not a goal is scored, the attacking Player will receive a penalty (minor or major, \\nas the Referee deems appropriate). In all cases where the infraction being imposed is to the attacking Player for hindering the goal-\\nkeeper’s ability to move freely in their goal crease, the penalty to be assessed is for “Goalkeeper interference”.\\nIn exercising their judgment, the Referee should give more significant consideration to the degree and nature of the relevant contact\\nwith the goalkeeper than to the exact location of the goalkeeper at the time of the contact.\\n69.3. CONTACT INSIDE THE GOAL CREASE\\nIf an attacking Player initiates \"a relevant contact\" with a goalkeeper, incidental or otherwise, while the goalkeeper is in their goal \\ncrease, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed.\\nIf a goalkeeper, in the “act of establishing their position” within their goal crease, initiates contact with an attacking Player who is in \\nthe goal crease, and this results in an impairment of the goalkeeper’s ability to defend their goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will \\nbe disallowed.\\nIf, after any contact by a goalkeeper who is attempting to establish position in their goal crease, the attacking Player does not im- \\nmediately vacate their current position in the goal crease (i.e., give ground to the goalkeeper), and a goal is scored, the goal will be \\ndisallowed. In all such cases, whether or not a goal is scored, the attacking Player will receive the appropriate penalty for \"Goal -\\nkeeper interference”.\\nIf an attacking Player establishes a “significant position” within the goal crease, so as to obstruct the goalkeeper’s vision and impair\\ntheir ability to defend their goal, and a goal is scored, the goal will be disallowed.\\nFor this purpose, a Player “establishes a significant position within the crease” when, in the Referee’s judgment, their body,\\nor a substantial portion thereof, is within the goal crease for more than an instantaneous period of time.\\n ➔ For more information refer to Appendix IV – Table 16 – Interference on the Goalkeeper Situations.\\n69.4.

The appropriate penalty should be assessed in every \\ncase where an attacking Player makes “unnecessary contact” with the goalkeeper.\\nHowever, “incidental contact” will be permitted when the goalkeeper is in the act of playing the puck outside their goal crease provi-\\nded the attacking Player has made a “reasonable effort” to avoid such unnecessary contact.\\nWhen a goalkeeper has played the puck outside of their goal crease and is then prevented from returning to their goal crease area \\ndue to the deliberate actions of an attacking Player, such Player may be penalized for “Goalkeeper interference”.\\nSimilarly, the goalkeeper may be penalized, if by their actions outside of their goal crease they deliberately interfere with an atta- \\ncking Player who is attempting to play the puck or an opponent.\\n ➔ For more information refer to Appendix IV – Table 16 – Interference on the Goalkeeper Situations.\\n69.5.

REBOUNDS AND LOOSE PUCKS\\nIn a rebound situation, or where a goalkeeper and attacking Player(s) are simultaneously attempting to play a loose puck, whether \\ninside or outside the goal crease, “incidental contact” with the goalkeeper will be permitted, and any goal that is scored as a result \\nthereof will be allowed.\\nIn the event a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck by an attacking Player after making a stop, the goal \\nwill be disallowed. If applicable, appropriate penalties will be assessed.\\nIf, however, in the opinion of the Referee, the attacking Player was pushed or otherwise fouled by a defending Player causing the \\ngoalkeeper to be pushed into the net together with the puck, the goal can be permitted.\\nIn the event the puck is under a Player in or around the goal crease area (deliberately or otherwise), a goal cannot be scored by \\npushing this Player together with the puck into the goal.

FACE-OFF\\nThe action of the Referee or Linesperson in dropping the puck between the sticks of two opposing Players to start or resume play \\nis called a “face-off”. A “face-off” begins when the Official indicates the “location of the “face-off” and the Officials and Players take \\ntheir appropriate positions. The “face-off” ends when the puck has been legally dropped.\\nA goalkeeper may not participate in a “face-off”.\\n76.2. FACE-OFF LOCATIONS\\nAll “face-off” must be conducted on one of the nine (9) face-off spots located on the rink.\\nIf two (2) rule violations are the reason for the stoppage of play (e.g.: “high-sticking the puck” and “intentional off-side”), the ensuing \\n“face-off location” shall be determined as the spot that provides the least amount of “territorial advantage” to the offending team.\\nWhen the play is stopped for any reason not specifically attributable to either team while the puck is in the neutral zone, the ensuing \\n“face-off” shall be conducted at the nearest face-off spot outside the blue line whenever possible. When it is unclear as to which of \\nthe four (4) face-off spots is the nearest, the spot that gives the home team the greatest “territorial advantage” in the neutral zone \\nwill be selected for the ensuing “face-off”.\\nWhen Players are penalized at a stoppage of play so as to result in penalties being placed on the penalty time clock to one team, \\nthe ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the two (2) face-off spots in the offending team’s defending zone. There are only \\nthree (3) exceptions to this application:\\n(I) when a penalty is assessed after the scoring of a goal – “face-off” shall be conducted at center ice;\\n(II) when a penalty is assessed at the end (or start) of a period – “face-off” shall be conducted at center ice;\\n(III) or when the defending team is penalized, and the attacking Players enter the attacking zone beyond the outer edge of the \\nend zone face-off circle – “face-off” shall be conducted in the neutral zone (see paragraph 11 of this section).\\nThe team awarded the “Power-Play” will have the choice of which end zone spot the “face-off” will take place at to start the “Power-\\nPlay”.\\nWhen an infringement of a rule has been committed by Players of both teams in the play resulting in the stoppage, the ensuing\\n“face-off” will be conducted at the nearest face-off spot in that zone.\\nWhen stoppage occurs between the end face-off spots and near end of the rink, the puck shall be faced-off at the end face-off spot\\non the side where the stoppage occurs unless otherwise expressly provided by these rules.\\nNo “face-off” shall be made within 4.50m of the goal or side boards nor anywhere other than at a face-off spot.\\nWhen a goal is illegally scored as a result of a puck being deflected directly off an Official, the resulting “face-off” shall be made at \\nthe nearest face-off spot in the zone where the puck deflected off of the Official.\\nWhen a goal is illegally scored by the attacking team by “directing”, “batting”, “kicking” or “high-sticking” the puck into the goal, the\\nresulting “face-off” shall take place in the neutral zone at the nearest face-off spot.\\n10   SECTION · GAME FLOW\\n\\n<<<PAGE 115>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nWhen the game is stopped for any reason not specifically covered in the official rules, the puck must be “faced-off” at a face-off spot\\nin the zone nearest to where it was last played.\\nFollowing a stoppage of play, should one or both defensemen who are the “point Players” or any Player coming from the Players’ \\nbench of the attacking team, enter into the attacking zone beyond the outer edge of the end zone face-off circle during an alterca -\\ntion, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the neutral zone near the blue line of the defending team. This \\nrule also applies when an “icing”, an “intentional off-side”, or a penalty has been assessed, and the ensuing “face-off” is to be in the \\noffending team’s defending zone.\\nShould any of the non-offending Players enter the attacking zone beyond the outer edge of the end zone face-off circle during an \\naltercation, “gathering or scrum”, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place in the neutral zone near the blue line of the defending team.\\nFor a violation of ➔ Rule 71 – Premature Substitution,  the resulting “face-off” will take place at the center ice face-off spot when \\nplay is stopped beyond the center red line. When play is stopped prior to the center red line, the resulting “face-off” shall be conduc- \\nted at the nearest face-off spot in the zone where the play was stopped.\\nWhen play is stopped for an injured Player, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at the face-off spot in the zone nearest the \\nlocation of the puck when the play was stopped. When the injured Player’s team has “control of the puck” in the attacking zone, the \\n“face-off” shall be conducted at one of the face-off spots outside the blue line in the neutral zone. When the injured Player is in their \\ndefending zone and the attacking team is in “control of the puck” in the attacking zone, the “face-off” shall be conducted at one of \\nthe defending team’s end-zone face-off spots.\\n76.3. FACE-OFF PROCEDURE\\nAs soon as the line change procedure has been completed by the Referee and they lower their hand to indicate no further changes, \\nthe Linesperson conducting the “face-off” shall blow their whistle.\\nThis will signal to both teams that they have no more than five (5) seconds to line up for the ensuing “face-off”. At the end of the five \\n(5) seconds (or sooner if both centers are ready), the Linesperson will conduct a proper “face-off”. \\nHowever if:\\n(I) One or both centers are not positioned for the “face-off”,\\n(II) One or both centers refrain from placing their stick on the ice,\\n(III) Any Player has encroached into the face-off circle,\\n(IV) Any Player makes physical contact with an opponent,\\n(V) Any Player who lines up for the “face-off” in an off-side position, or\\n(VI) One of the centers wins the face-off by using the skates,\\nthe Linesperson shall have the offending center(s) may assess a warning for a “face-off” violation prior to dropping the puck. \\nIn the last two (2) minutes of regulation time or any time in overtime, the Linesperson will still blow their whistle to initiate the \\n“face-off”, but the five (5) second time limit will not be enforced. However, Players must abide by the verbal directions given by the \\nLinesperson in their attempt to conduct a fast and fair “face-off”.\\n76.4. FACE-OFF PROCEDURE – CENTERS\\nThe puck shall be faced-off by the Referee or the Linesperson dropping the puck on the ice between the sticks of the Players facing-\\noff. Players facing-off will stand squarely facing their opponent’s end of the rink approximately one stick length apart with the blade \\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 10  130\\nGAME FLOW\\n10   SECTION · GAME FLOW\\n\\n<<<PAGE 116>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nof their sticks on the ice.\\nWhen the “face-off” takes place at any of the nine face-off spots, the Players taking part shall take their position so that they will \\nstand squarely facing their opponent’s end of the rink, and clear of the ice markings (where applicable). The sticks of both Players \\nfacing-off shall have the blade on the ice, within the designated white area. At the eight (8) face-off spots (excluding center ice face-\\noff spot), the defending Player shall place their stick within the designated white area first followed immediately by the attacking \\nPlayer. When the “face-off” is conducted at the center ice face-off spot, the visiting Player shall place their stick on the ice first.\\nIf a Player facing-off fails to take their proper position immediately when directed by the On-Ice Official, the Official may assess a\\nwarning for a “face-off” violation.\\nIf a center is not at the designated “face-off” area once the five (5) second time limit has elapsed, the Linesperson will drop the puck\\nimmediately. If the center is back from the face-off spot, is “quarterbacking” or refuses to come into the “face-off” area when instruc-\\nted to do so by the Linesperson, or the center is simply slow getting to the face-off spot when the five (5) seconds has elapsed, the \\npuck shall be dropped. If the center attempts to arrive at the face-off spot just as the five seconds elapses in an attempt to gain an \\nadvantage to win the “face-off”, the center will be warned by the Linesperson that they have committed a “face-off” violation.\\nIf a Player received a warning for a “face-off” violation, they must come into position quickly or risk having the puck dropped by the \\nLinesperson without the Player being set or will result in a bench minor penalty for “Delay of Game” for a second “face-off” violation \\nduring the same “face-off”.\\n76.5. DELAYING THE GAME\\nThe two players involved in the actual face-off (the centers) are not permitted to play the puck with their hand without incurring a \\npenalty under ➔ Rule 67.2 – Handling Puck  until such time as a third player (from either team) has at least touched the puck. Once \\nthe face-off is deemed complete (and a winner of the face-off is clear) hand passes shall be enforced as per Rule 79 – Hand Pass.\\n76.6. FACE-OFF PROCEDURE – OTHER PLAYERS\\nNo other Player shall be allowed to enter the face-off circle or come within 4.5m of the Players facing-off. All Players must stand \\non-side on all “face-offs”. During end-zone “face-offs”, all other Players on the ice must position their bodies on their own side of the \\nrestraining lines marked on the outer edge of the face-off circles.\\nIf a Player other than the Player taking the “face-off” moves into the face-off circle prior to the dropping of the puck, then the offen-\\nding team taking the “face-off” shall receive a warning for a “face-off” violation.\\nPlayers on the attacking team (exclusive of the center) must establish their position first and then the defending team may coun- ter \\nand hold its position until the puck is dropped. A violation of this procedure shall be treated as “face-off” encroachment and the \\nLinesperson shall assess a warning for a “face-off” violation to the offending team.\\nShould an attacking Player attempt to establish a new position prior to the “face-off”, and the defending center steps back from the \\nface-off spot in order to reposition their teammates, the “face-off” violation shall be charged to the attacking team as they must \\nestablish their position first.\\n76.7. FACE-OFF PROCEDURE – VIOLATIONS\\nIf a center should move prematurely prior to the “face-off”, or if the Referee or Linesperson shall have dropped the puck unfairly, \\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 10  131\\nGAME FLOW\\n10   SECTION · GAME FLOW\\n\\n<<<PAGE 117>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nthe “face-off” shall be considered a “face-off” violation. A warning shall be issued to the offending team and the “face-off” must be \\nconducted again. \\nWhen two (2) “face-off” violations” have been committed by the same team during the same “face-off”, this team shall be penalized \\nwith a bench minor penalty to the offending team. This penalty shall be announced as a “bench minor penalty for “Delay of Game” \\n– Face-off Violation.”\\n“Face-off” violations shall be summarized as follows (any of the four (4) On-Ice Officials may identify a “face-off” violation):\\n(I) Encroachment by any Player other than the center into the “face-off” area prior to the puck being dropped. Players on \\nthe perimeter of the face-off circle must keep both skates outside the face-off circle – skate contact with the line is \\npermitted. If a Player\\'s skate crosses the line into the face-off circle prior to the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed \\nas a “face-off” violation. A Player\\'s stick may be inside the face-off circle provided there is no physical contact with their \\nopponent or their opponent\\'s stick.\\n(II) Encroachment by any Player into the area between the hash marks on the outer edges of the face-off circle prior to the \\npuck being dropped. Players must also ensure that both of their skates do not cross their respective hash marks. Contact \\nwith the line with their skate is permitted. If a Player\\'s skate crosses the line into the area between the hash marks prior \\nto the drop of the puck, this shall be deemed as a “face-off” violation. A Player\\'s stick may be inside the area between the \\nhash marks provided there is no physical contact with their opponent or their opponent\\'s stick.\\n(III) Any physical contact with an opponent prior to the puck being dropped. If either Player taking the “face-off” makes \\nhelmet-to-helmet contact with their opponent, they must receive a first “face-off” violation warning. If the Linesperson \\ncannot differentiate which Player initiated the contact, both Players must receive a first “face-off” violation warning.\\n(IV) Failure by either center taking the “face-off” to “properly position themself behind the restraining lines” or place their stick \\non the ice – as outlined in Rule 76.4 – Face-off Procedure – Centers.\\n\"Properly position themself behind the restraining lines\" shall mean that the center must place their feet on either side of \\nthe restraining lines that are parallel to the side boards (contact with the lines is permissible), and the toe of the blade of \\ntheir skates must not cross over the restraining lines that are perpendicular to the side boards as they approach the face-\\noff spot. The blade of the stick must then be placed on the ice, at least the toe of the blade of the stick, in the designated \\nwhite area of the face-off spot and must remain there until the puck is dropped.\\n(V) Failure to comply with this positioning and “face-off” procedure will result in a “face-off” violation.\\nWhenever a team has committed two (2) “face-off” violations during the same “face-off”, the Referee shall immediately assess the \\noffending team a bench minor penalty for “Delay of Game”. This penalty shall be announced as a bench minor penalty for Delay of \\nGame – Face-off Violation.\\nPlayers who are late to the “face-off” location and therefore in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once \\nin the game by the Referee. This warning will also be given to the offending team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending team’s \\ncenter will not receive a warning for a “face-off” violation. Any subsequent violation shall result in a bench minor penalty for “Delay \\nof Game” being assessed to the offending team. This penalty shall be announced as a “bench minor penalty for “Delay of Game” – \\nSlow Proceeding to Face-off Location.\\nIn the conduct of any “face-off” at any of the nine (9) face-off spots on the playing surface, no Player facing-off shall make any phy-\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 10  132\\nGAME FLOW\\n10   SECTION · GAME FLOW\\n\\n<<<PAGE 118>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nsical contact with their opponent’s body by means of their own body or by their stick except in the course of playing the puck after \\nthe “face-off” has been completed.\\nFor violation of this rule, the Referee may, at their discretion impose a minor penalty or penalties on the Player(s) whose action(s) \\ncaused the “physical contact”. Nonetheless, this “physical contact” prior to the dropping of the puck shall be deemed as a “face-off” \\nviolation and the center will be warned by the Linesperson that the team has committed a “face-off” violation and any subsequent \\nviolation will result in a bench minor penalty for “Delay of Game” – “face-off” violation being assessed.\\n“Face-off” encroachment may be applied during “face-offs” at any of the nine (9) face-off spots on the playing surface. However, sin-\\nce no such lines are painted on the ice at the four (4) face-off spots adjacent to the blue lines, Linespersons shall use their judgment \\nas to whether or not a violation has occurred. All Players, other than the centers, shall be uniformly back from the “face-off” location \\nsimilar to being outside the face-off circle for “face-offs” in the end zones.\\n76.8. FACE-OFF PROCEDURE – LINE CHANGES\\nNo substitution of Players shall be permitted until the “face-off” has been completed and play has resumed except when a penalty \\nis imposed which affects the on-ice strength of either team.\\nShould an On-Ice Official notice that the defending team has not placed enough Players on the ice for the ensuing “face-off”, the \\nReferee in the neutral zone shall be notified and they will instruct the offending team to place another Player(s) on the ice. If, in the \\nopinion of the Referee that this is being done as a “stalling tactic”, they will issue a warning to the offending team’s Coach and any \\nsubsequent violations shall result in the assessment of a bench minor penalty for “Delay of Game”.\\nShould an On-Ice Official notice that the attacking team has not placed enough Players on the ice for the ensuing “face-off”, the Line- \\nsperson will proceed with conducting the “face-off” in the normal manner. The attacking team must ensure they put the appropriate \\nnumber of Players on the ice at all times.\\n76.9. FACE-OFF PROCEDURE – VERIFICATION OF TIME\\nAny loss of time on the game or penalty clocks due to a false “face-off” or a “face-off” violation must be replaced. The Video Review \\nConsultant may be consulted to ensure the time is accurately replaced. ➔ Rule 37.6 – Video Review to verify time on clock\\nThe whistle will not be blown by the Official to start play. Playing time will commence from the instant the puck is “faced-off” and will \\nstop when the whistle is blown, or a goal is scored.\\nRULE 77  GAME AND INTERMISSION TIMING\\n77.1. GAME TIMING\\nThe time allowed for a game shall be three (3) twenty-minute (20) periods of actual play with a rest intermission between periods.\\n77.2. INTERMISSION TIMING\\nPlay shall be resumed promptly following each intermission upon the expiration of fifteen (15) minutes or a length of time designa-\\nted by the IIHF from the completion of play in the preceding period. Timing of the intermission commences after termination of the \\nperiod.\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 10  133\\nGAME FLOW\\n10   SECTION · GAME FLOW\\n\\n<<<PAGE 119>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n ➔ Rule 34 – Game Timekeeper\\nFor the purpose of keeping the spectators informed as to the time remaining during intermissions, the Game Timekeeper will use \\nthe electronic clock to record length of intermissions.\\n77.3. DELAYS\\nIf any unusual delay occurs within 10 minutes of the end of the first or second periods, the Referee may order the next regular  \\nintermission to be taken immediately.\\nThe balance of the period will be completed on the resumption of play with the teams defending the same goals after which  \\nthe teams will change ends and resume play of the ensuing period without delay.\\nRULE 78  GOALS\\n78.1. GOALS AND ASSISTS\\nIt is the responsibility of the Referees to award goals and report the ”goal scorer” and “assists”, and their decision in this respect is \\nfinal, notwithstanding the report of the Referee or any other Game Official.\\nThe Officials Scorekeeper, with the assistance of the Statistic staff will confirm the “goal scorer” and any Player deserving an “as -\\nsist”. This decision is final in this regard and no changes can be made after the conclusion of the game. The use of video replay to \\nverify the proper awarding of a goal or an assist is essential. Such awards shall be made or withheld strictly in accordance with the \\nprovisions of this rule. Therefore, it is essential that the Official Scorekeeper be thoroughly familiar with every aspect of this rule; \\nbe alerted to observe all actions which could affect the awarding of a goal or assist; and, above all, give or withhold awards with \\nabsolute impartiality.\\nIn case of an obvious error in awarding a goal or an assist that has been announced, it should be corrected promptly, but changes \\nshould not be made in the official scoring summary after the Referee has signed the game report. The team scoring the greatest \\nnumber of goals during the three (3) twenty-minute periods shall be the winner and shall be credited with three (3) points in the \\nstandings.\\nIn the event a winner during the Round Robin or Preliminary Round is determined in the overtime period or the shootout, the winning \\nteam shall be credited with two (2) points in the standings and the losing team will be credited with one (1) point in the standings.\\n78.2. CREDITING GOALS\\nA “goal” shall be credited in the scoring records to a Player who shall have propelled the puck into the opponent’s goal. Each “goal” \\nshall count one point in the Player’s record. Only one point can be credited to any one Player on a goal.\\n78.3. CREDITING ASSISTS\\nWhen a Player scores a goal, an “assist” shall be credited to the Player or Players (maximum two) who touch the puck prior to the \\n“goal scorer” provided no defender plays or has “control of the puck” subsequently. Each “assist” shall count one point in the Player’s \\nrecord. Only one point can be credited to any one Player on a goal.\\n78.4. SCORING A GOAL\\nA goal shall be scored when the puck shall have been put between the goal posts by the stick of a Player of the attacking side, from \\nin front and below the crossbar, and entirely across a red line the width of the diameter of the goal posts drawn on the ice from one \\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 10  134\\nGAME FLOW\\n10   SECTION · GAME FLOW\\n\\n<<<PAGE 120>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\ngoal post to the other with the goal frame in its proper position. The goal frame shall be considered in its proper position when at \\nleast a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still inside both the goal post and the hole in the ice. The flexible pegs could be bent, but \\nas long as at least a portion of the flexible peg(s) are still in the hole in the ice and the goal post, the goal frame shall be deemed to \\nbe in its proper position. The goal frame could be raised somewhat on one post (or both), but as long as the flexible pegs are still in \\ncontact with the holes in the ice and the goal posts, the goal frame shall not be deemed to be displaced. \\nA goal shall be scored if the puck is shot into the goal by a Player of the defending side. The Player of the attacking side who last \\ntouched the puck shall be credited with the goal, but no assist shall be awarded.\\nA goal shall be scored if the puck is put into the goal in any other manner by a Player of the defending side. The Player of the atta -\\ncking side who last touched the puck shall be credited with the goal and assists may be awarded.\\nIf an attacking Player has the puck deflect into the net, off their skate or body, in any manner, the goal shall be allowed. The Player \\nwho deflected the puck shall be credited with the goal.\\nShould a Player legally propel a puck into the goal crease of the opponent team and the puck should become loose and available\\nto another Player of the attacking side, a goal scored on the play shall be legal.\\n78.5. DISALLOWED GOALS\\nApparent goals shall be disallowed by the Referee and the appropriate announcement made by the Public Address Announcer for  \\nthe following reasons:\\n(I) When the puck has been directed with any part of their body (excl. skates), batted or thrown into the net by an atta -\\ncking Player other than with a stick. When this occurs, if it is deemed to be done deliberately, then the decision shall be  \\nNO GOAL. A goal cannot be scored when the puck has been deliberately batted with any part of the attacking Player’s body  \\ninto the net ➔ Rule 78.4 – Scoring a Goal.\\n(II) When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion ➔ Rule 49.2 – Kicking.\\n(III) When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official ➔ Rule 85.4 – Puck Striking Official.\\n(IV) When a goal has been scored and an ineligible Player is on the ice ➔ Rule 68.5 – Disallowed Goal.\\n(V) When an attacking Player has interfered with a goalkeeper in their goal crease ➔ Rule 69.1 – Interference on the Goal -\\nkeeper.\\n(VI) When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking Player’s stick that is above the height of the \\ncrossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor ➔ Rule 80.3 – Disallowed Goal.\\n(VII) When video review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play \\nmust be disallowed ➔ Rule 37.2 – Video Review.\\n(VIII) (VIII) When a Linesperson reports a double-minor penalty for high-sticking or a major penalty to the Referee following \\nthe scoring of a goal by the offending team, the goal must be disallowed, and the appropriate penalty assessed ➔ Rule \\n32.4 – Reporting to Referee.\\n(IX) When a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save ➔ Rule 69.7 – Rebounds \\nand Loose Pucks.\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 10  135\\nGAME FLOW\\n10   SECTION · GAME FLOW\\n\\n<<<PAGE 121>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n(X) When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are \\nno longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck en-\\nters the goal. However, if this occurs as a result of the actions of a defending Player, refer to ➔ Rule 63.7 – Awarded Goal.\\n(XI) During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending team cannot score unless the non-offending team shoots the \\npuck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending Player or any physical action by an offending \\nPlayer that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall  \\nbe stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending team;\\n(XII) When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if they have not physically had the opportunity to stop  \\nplay by blowing their whistle;\\n(XIII) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.\\nRULE 79  HAND PASS\\n79.1. HAND PASS\\nA Player shall be permitted to stop or “bat” a puck in the air with their open hand, or push it along the ice with their hand, and the \\nplay shall not be stopped unless, in the opinion of the On-Ice Officials, they have directed the puck to a teammate, or have allowed \\ntheir team to gain an advantage, and subsequently possession and control of the puck is obtained by a Player of the offending team, \\neither directly or deflected off any Player or official. For violations related to “closing their hand on the puck”, refer to Handling Puck:\\n ➔ Rule 67 – Handling Puck.\\n79.2. DEFENDING ZONE\\nPlay will not be stopped for any hand pass by Players in their own defending zone. The location of the puck when contacted by either \\nthe Player making the hand pass or the Player receiving the hand pass shall determine the zone it is in.\\n79.3. FACE-OFF LOCATION\\nWhen a hand pass violation has occurred, the ensuing “face-off” shall take place at the nearest face-off spot in the zone where the \\noffense occurred, unless the offending team gains a territorial advantage, then the “face-off” shall be at the nearest face-off spot in \\nthe zone where the stoppage of play occurred, unless otherwise covered in the rules. When a hand pass violation occurs by a team \\nin their attacking zone, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the face-off spots outside the defending team’s blue line \\nin the neutral zone.\\nRULE 80  HIGH-STICKING THE PUCK\\n80.1. HIGH-STICKING THE PUCK\\nBatting the puck above the normal height of the shoulders with a stick is prohibited. When a puck is struck with a “high stick” and \\nsubsequently comes into the “possession and control” of a Player from the offending team (including the Player who made contact \\nwith the puck), either directly or deflected off any Player or official, there shall be a whistle.\\nWhen a puck has been contacted by a “high stick”, the play shall be permitted to continue, provided that: \\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 10  136\\nGAME FLOW\\n10   SECTION · GAME FLOW\\n\\n<<<PAGE 122>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n(I) The puck has been batted to an opponent (when a Player bats the puck to an opponent, the Referee shall give  \\nthe “washout” signal immediately – otherwise, they will stop the play).\\n(II) A Player of the defending side shall bat the puck into their own goal in which case the goal shall be allowed.\\nCradling the puck on the blade of the stick (“lacrosse style”) above the normal height of the shoulders shall be prohibited and  \\na stoppage of play shall result. If this is done by a Player on a “Penalty Shot” or Shootout attempt, the shot shall be stopped  \\nimmediately and considered complete.\\n ➔ Rule 60 – High-sticking.\\n80.2. FACE-OFF LOCATION\\nWhen the play is stopped for the “high-sticking the puck” violation, the ensuing “face-off” must take place at the spot that provides \\nthe least amount of “territorial advantage” to the team striking the puck, either where the puck was contacted illegally, or where it \\nwas last played by the offending team.\\nIf the attacking team is at fault and the play is stopped while the puck is in the attacking zone, the ensuing “face-off” must be moved\\nto the nearest face-off spot in the neutral zone.\\n80.3. DISALLOWED GOAL\\nWhen an attacking Player causes the puck to enter the opponent’s goal by contacting the puck above the height of the crossbar, \\neither directly or deflected off any Player or official, the goal shall not be allowed. The determining factor is where the puck makes \\ncontact with the stick.\\nIf the puck makes contact with the stick at or below the level of the crossbar and enters the goal, this goal shall be allowed.\\nA goal scored as a result of a defending Player striking the puck with their stick carried above the height of the crossbar of the goal \\nframe into their own goal shall be allowed.\\nRULE 81 ICING\\n81.1. ICING\\nFor the purpose of this rule, the center red line will divide the ice into halves. Should any Player of a team, equal or superior in “nu -\\nmerical strength” (power-play) to the opposing team, shoot, bat or deflect the puck from their own half of the ice beyond the goal \\nline of the opposing team, play shall be stopped. For the purpose of deflected pucks, this only applies when the puck was originally \\npropelled down the ice by the offending team.\\nFor the purpose of this rule, the point of last contact with the puck by the team in possession shall be used to determine whether \\nicing has occurred or not. As such, the team in possession must “gain the line” in order for the icing to be nullified. “Gaining the line” \\nshall mean that the puck, while on the Player’s stick (not the Player’s skate) must make contact with the center red line in order to \\nnullify a potential icing.\\nFor the purpose of interpretation of the rule, there are two judgments required for \"icing the puck\". The Linesperson must first \\ndetermine that the puck will cross the goal line. Once the Linesperson determines that the puck will cross the goal line, “icing” is \\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 10  137\\nGAME FLOW\\n10   SECTION · GAME FLOW\\n\\n<<<PAGE 123>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\ncompleted upon the determination as to which Player (attacking or defending) would first touch the puck.\\nThis decision by the Linesperson will be made by no later than the instant the first Player reaches the end zone “face-off” dots with \\nthe Player\\'s skate being the determining factor. Should the puck be shot down the ice in such a manner that it travels around the \\nboards and/or back towards the end zone “face-off” dots, the same procedure shall be in effect in that the Linesperson shall determi-\\nne within a similar distance as to who will have touched the puck first.\\nFor clarification, the determining factor is which Player would first touch the puck, not which Player would first reach the end zone\\n“face-off” dots.\\nIf the “race for the puck” is too close to determine by the time the first Player reaches the End Zone “face-off” dots, “icing” shall\\nbe called.\\nThe puck striking or deflecting off an Official does not automatically nullify a potential “icing”.\\nIf there is no “race” for the puck, icing should not be called until a defending skater crosses its defending blue line and the puck \\ncrosses the goal line (not between the goal posts).\\n81.2. ICING – FACE-OFF LOCATION\\nFollowing an “icing”, the attacking team will have the choice of which end zone dot the “face-off” will take place.\\nIf, in the opinion of the Referee, the defending side intentionally abstains from playing the puck promptly when they are in a position \\nto do so, they shall stop the play and order the resulting “face-off” on the adjacent corner face-off spot nearest the goal of the team \\nat fault.\\nIf the Linesperson shall have erred in calling an “icing the puck” infraction (regardless of whether either team is “short-handed”), the\\npuck shall be “faced-off” on the center ice face-off spot.\\n81.3. GOALKEEPER\\nIf, in the opinion of the Linesperson, the goalkeeper feigns playing the puck, attempts to play the puck, or skates in the direction of \\nthe puck on an icing at any time, the “potential icing” shall not be called, and play shall continue.\\nIf, however, a goalkeeper is legitimately out of the crease in an attempt to go to the Players’ bench to be substituted for an extra\\nattacker and in no way makes an attempt to play the puck, the “icing” should not be nullified under this section.\\nIf the goalkeeper is out of their crease prior to the shot being taken, and simply retreats to their crease making no attempt to play \\nthe puck or feign playing the puck, the “potential icing” shall remain in effect.\\n81.4. LINE CHANGE ON ICING\\nA team that is in violation of this rule shall not be permitted to make any Player substitutions prior to the ensuing “face-off”.\\nHowever, a team shall be permitted to make a Player substitution to replace a goalkeeper who had been substituted for an extra \\nattacker, to replace an injured Player, a Player with a broken skate, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects the on-ice \\nstrength of either team. The determination of Players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the offending Player’s stick.\\n81.5. NO ICING\\nWhen the puck is shot and rebounds from the body or stick of an opponent in their own half of the ice so as to cross the goal line of \\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 10  138\\nGAME FLOW\\n10   SECTION · GAME FLOW\\n\\n<<<PAGE 124>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nthe Player shooting, it shall not be considered “icing”.\\nWhen a puck is shot by a team from their own half of the ice and is deflected several times before crossing the center red line, icing \\nshall be nullified if at least one of these deflections was off an opposing Player.\\nIf the puck shall go beyond the goal line in the opposite half of the ice directly from either of the Players while facing-off, it shall not \\nbe considered a violation of this rule.\\nIf, in the opinion of the Linesperson, any Player (other than the goalkeeper) of the opposing team is able to play the puck before it \\npasses their goal line, but has not done so, play shall continue and the “icing” violation shall not be called. This includes the situ- \\nation whereby the opposing team, while in the process of making Player substitutions during the play, are able to play the puck, but \\nchoose not to do so to avoid being called for “too many Players on the ice”. “Icing” should not be called.\\nIf the puck touches any part of a Player of the opposing side, including their skates or their stick, or if it touches any part of the \\nopposing team’s goalkeeper, including their skates or their stick, at any time before or after crossing the goal line, it shall not be \\nconsidered “icing”.\\nIf a goalkeeper takes any action to dislodge the puck from the back of the net, “icing” shall not be called.\\n81.6. ICING – NUMERICAL STRENGTH\\nIf the puck was so shot by a Player of a side below the numerical strength of the opposing team, play shall continue, and the “icing” \\nviolation shall not be called.\\nWhen a team is “short-handed” as the result of a penalty and the penalty is about to expire, the decision as to whether there has been \\nan “icing” shall be determined at the instant the penalty expires. Should the puck be released from the stick of the Player shooting \\nthe puck down the ice prior to the penalty expiring, the “icing” infraction shall not apply. The action of the penalized Player remaining \\nin the penalty box will not alter the ruling.\\nRULE 82  LINE CHANGES\\n82.1. LINE CHANGE\\nFollowing the stoppage of play, the visiting team shall promptly place a line-up on the ice ready for play and no substitution shall be \\nmade from that time until play has been resumed. The home team may then make any desired substitution, except in cases follo -\\nwing an “icing”, which does not result in the delay of the game. \\n“Placing a line-up on the ice” shall mean that both teams shall place the full complement of Players (and not exceed) to which they \\nare entitled within the line change time frame.\\nIf there is any undue delay by either team in changing Players, the Referee shall order the offending team or teams to take their \\npositions immediately and not permit any further Player changes.\\nWhen a substitution has been made under the above rule, no additional substitution may be made until play commences. \\nOnce the line change procedure has been completed, no additional Player substitutions shall be permitted until the “face-off” has \\nbeen completed legally and play has resumed, except when a penalty or penalties are imposed that affect the “on-ice strength” of \\neither or both teams. This may include penalties imposed following the completion of the line change and prior to the “face-off”, or \\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 10  139\\nGAME FLOW\\n10   SECTION · GAME FLOW\\n\\n<<<PAGE 125>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\ndue to a penalty assessed for a “face-off” violation – refer to Rule 82.2 – Line Change – Procedure.\\nA team that is in violation of ➔ Rule 63.8 – Delaying the Game  or ➔ Rule 81 – Icing,  shall not be permitted to make any Player \\nsubstitutions prior to the ensuing “face-off”. However, a team shall be permitted to make a Player substitution to replace a goalkee-\\nper who had been substituted for an extra attacker, to replace an injured Player, or when a penalty has been assessed which affects \\nthe “on-ice strength” of either team. The determination of Players on ice will be made when the puck leaves the offending Player’s \\nstick.\\nGoalkeepers’ substitution during a game will be conducted within the same time frame as a regular line change. No extra time will \\nbe allotted to the goalkeeper coming off the bench, except in the case where an injury to a goalkeeper occurs.\\n82.2. LINE CHANGE – PROCEDURE\\nFollowing a stoppage of play, the Referee will enforce the following line change procedure once they have determined that this  \\nprocedure may begin:\\n(I) The Referee shall give the visiting team up to five (5) seconds to make its line change.\\n(II) The Referee shall raise their hand to indicate no further changes by the visiting team and to commence the home  \\nteam’s line change.\\n(III) The Referee shall give the home team up to eight (8) seconds to make its line change.\\n(IV) The Referee shall lower their hand to indicate no further changes by the home team.\\n(V) Any attempt by the either team to make a change after the Referee’s signal, attempt to place too many Players on the ice \\nfor the subsequent line change, or attempt to make additional personnel changes, shall not be permitted and the Referee \\nwill send the Players who have attempted to change back to their Players’ bench. The Referee will then issue a warning to \\nthe offending team (through the Coach) indicating that any subsequent violations during the rest of the game (including \\novertime), shall result in a bench minor penalty for “delaying the game”. This penalty shall be announced as a “bench \\nminor penalty for “Delay of Game” – Improper Line Change.”\\n(VI) The Linesperson conducting the “face-off” will blow their whistle (once the Referee has lowered their hand for the line \\nchanges) to indicate that all Players must be in position and on-side for the “face-off” within five (5) seconds. The “face-\\noff” will then be conducted ➔ Rule 76 – Face-offs.\\n(VII) Players who are slow (after the five-second warning whistle given by the Linesperson) getting to the “face-off” location \\nor who are in an off-side position for the ensuing “face-off” will be warned once in the game by the Referee. This war -\\nning will also be given to the offending team’s Coach. In this situation, the offending team’s center is not ejected from \\nthe “face-off”. Any subsequent violation shall result in a bench minor penalty for “Delay of Game” being assessed to the \\noffending team.\\n(VIII) In the last two (2) minutes of regulation time and any time in the overtime period(s), points (vi) and (vii) above are not \\napplicable. The Linesperson shall give the teams a reasonable amount of time to set up for the ensuing “face-off” after \\npoints (i) through (v) above have been enforced.\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 10  140\\nGAME FLOW\\n10   SECTION · GAME FLOW\\n\\n<<<PAGE 126>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n82.3. LINE CHANGE – BENCH MINOR PENAL TY\\nThe home team is entitled to “last change”. This means the visiting Coach must put their Players out on the ice first, after which\\ntime the home Coach must do so. If either team does not make its changes promptly, the Referee will not permit the change. Failure \\nby either team to comply, or tardiness to comply, or deliberate error in complying with this rule will result first in a warning from the \\nReferee and then a bench minor penalty shall be assessed for “Delay of Game”.\\nPlayers must proceed directly to the location of the “face-off” to participate in the ensuing “face-off”. Any attempts to delay the\\ngame by stalling or otherwise unnecessary actions by either team shall result in the assessment of a bench minor penalty for “de -\\nlaying the game”. This penalty shall be announced as a “bench minor penalty for “Delay of Game” – Slow Proceeding to “Face- off \\nLocation (or Slow Proceeding to Players’ bench).”\\nDuring the play, if a Player wishes to retire from the ice and be replaced by a substitute, they must do so at the Players’ bench and \\nnot through any other exit leading from the rink. This is not a legal Player change and therefore when a violation occurs, a bench \\nminor penalty shall be imposed.\\nRULE 83  OFF-SIDE\\n83.1. OFF-SIDE\\nPlayers of the attacking team must not precede the puck into the attacking zone.\\nThe position of the Player’s skates and not that of their stick shall be the determining factor in all instances in deciding an “off-side”. \\nA Player is “off-side” when both skates are completely over the leading edge of the blue line involved in the play.\\nA Player is on-side when either of their skates are in contact with the blue line, or on their “own side” of the line, at the instant the \\npuck completely crosses the leading edge of the blue line. On their “own side” of the line shall be defined by a “plane” of the blue line \\nwhich shall extend from the leading edge of the blue line upwards. If a Player’s skate has yet to “break the plane” prior to the puck \\ncompletely crossing the leading edge, they are deemed to be “on-side” for the purpose of the “off-side” rule.\\nIf, during a delayed off-side, an attacking Player in the attacking zone elects to proceed to their Players’ bench (which extends into \\nthe attacking zone) to be replaced by a teammate, they shall be considered to have cleared the zone when both skates are off the \\nice and the Linesperson judges the skater to have left the playing surface.\\nA Player controlling the puck who shall cross the line ahead of the puck shall not be considered “off-side,” provided they have “pos-\\nsession and control” of the puck prior to their skates crossing the leading edge of the blue line.\\nIt should be noted that while the position of the Player’s skates is what determines whether a Player is “off-side,” nevertheless the \\nquestion of an “off-side” never arises until the puck has completely crossed the leading edge of the blue line at which time the de -\\ncision is to be made.\\nIf a Player legally carries, passes, or plays the puck back into their own defending zone while a Player of the opposing team is in such \\ndefending zone, the “off-side” shall be ignored, and play permitted to continue.\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 10  141\\nGAME FLOW\\n10   SECTION · GAME FLOW\\n\\n<<<PAGE 127>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\n83.2. OFF-SIDE – DEFLECTIONS / REBOUNDS\\nFor the purposes of this section, it is stipulated that an attacking Player has preceded the puck into the attacking zone.\\nWhen a defending Player propels the puck out of their defending zone and the puck clearly rebounds off a defending Player in the \\nneutral zone back into the defending zone, all attacking Players are eligible to play the puck. However, any action by an attacking \\nPlayer that causes a “deflection/rebound” off a defending Player in the neutral zone back into the defending zone (i.e. stick check, \\nbody check, physical contact), a “delayed off-side” shall be signaled by the Linesperson.\\nA puck that deflects back into the defending zone off an Official who is in the neutral zone will be “off-side” (or “delayed off-side”,\\nas appropriate).\\nA puck which deflects off an attacking Player outside the blue line into the attacking zone, regardless of who originally propelled it \\nor where it was propelled from, shall be ruled “off-side” or “delayed off-side”, as appropriate.\\nA puck which is propelled by the attacking team and deflects off any Player into the attacking zone shall be ruled “off-side”\\nor “delayed off-side”, as appropriate.\\n83.3. DELAYED OFF-SIDE\\nA situation where an attacking Player (or Players) has (have) preceded the puck across the attacking blue line, but the defending \\nteam is in a position to bring the puck back out of its defending zone without any delay or contact with an attacking Player or the \\nattacking Players are in the process of clearing the attacking zone. If an “off-side” call is delayed, the Linesperson shall drop their \\narm to nullify the “off-side” violation and allow play to continue if:\\n(I) All Players of the offending team clear the zone at the same instant (skate contact with the blue line, \"3D\" judgement is \\nnot used in this situation) permitting the attacking Players to re-enter the attacking zone, or\\n(II) the defending team passes or carries the puck into the neutral zone.\\nIf, during the course of the “delayed off-side”, any member of the attacking team touches the puck, attempts to “gain possession of \\na loose puck”, forces the defending puck carrier further back into their own zone, or who is about to make physical contact with the \\ndefending puck carrier, the Linesperson shall stop play for the “off-side” violation.\\nIf, during a “delayed off-side”, an attacking Player in the attacking zone elects to proceed to their Players’ bench (which extends into \\nthe attacking zone) to be replaced by a teammate, they shall be considered to have cleared the zone when both skates are off the \\nice and the Linesperson judges the Player to have left the playing surface. If their replacement comes onto the ice in the attacking \\nzone, while the “delayed off-side” is still in effect, they too must clear the attacking zone. Once all attacking Players have cleared \\nthe attacking zone and the Linesperson have lowered their arm for the “delayed off-side”, all attacking Players may legally enter the \\nattacking zone and pursue the puck.\\n83.4. DISALLOWED GOAL – OFF-SIDE\\nIf the puck is shot into the attacking zone creating a “delayed off-side”, the play shall be allowed to continue under the normal “clea- \\nring-the-zone” rules. Should the puck, as a result of this shot, enter the defending team’s goal, either directly or off the goalkeeper, \\na Player, the boards, the glass, a piece of equipment or an official on the ice, the goal shall be disallowed as the original shot was \\n“off-side”. The fact that the attacking team may have “cleared the zone” prior to the puck entering the goal has no bearing on this \\nruling. The “face-off” will be conducted at the face-off spot in the zone closest to the point of origin of the shot that gives the offen-\\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 10  142\\nGAME FLOW\\n10   SECTION · GAME FLOW\\n\\n<<<PAGE 128>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nding team the least amount of “territorial advantage”.\\nThe only way an attacking team can score a goal on a “delayed off-side” situation is if the defending team shoots or puts the puck \\ninto their own net without action or contact by the offending team.\\nOther than in situations involving a “delayed off-side” and the puck entering the goal or a successful Coach’s Challenge, no goal can \\nbe disallowed after the fact for an “off-side” violation, except for the human factor involved in blowing the whistle.\\n ➔ Rule 38 – Coach’s Challenge.\\n83.5. COACH’S CHALLENGE – OFF-SIDE\\n ➔ Rule 38 – Coach’s Challenge.\\n83.6. FACE-OFF LOCATION – OFF-SIDE\\nFor violation of this rule, the play is stopped and the puck shall be “faced-off” in the neutral zone at the face-off spot nearest the \\nattacking zone of the offending team when the violation occurs as a result of the attacking team carrying the puck over the attacking \\nblue line, or from the face-off spot in the zone closest to the point of origin of the shot or pass (even if deflected off an attacking or \\ndefending Player or an official).\\nFor every “delayed off-side” situation, including an “intentional off-side”, the Linesperson will raise their non-whistle arm. They will \\nallow play to continue and, if a stoppage of play occurs, there will be four possible “face-off” locations: \\n(I) If carried over the blue line – “face-off” outside the blue line.\\n(II) If shot into the attacking zone (or errant pass) – nearest face-off spot in the zone from which the pass or shot originated \\nthat gives the offending team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if deflected off an attacking or defending \\nPlayer or an official).\\n(III) If the defending Player is pressured or about to be checked by an attacking Player – nearest face-off spot in the zone \\nfrom which the pass or shot originated that gives the offending Team the least amount of “territorial advantage” (even if \\ndeflected off an attacking or defending Player or an official).\\n(IV) If deemed to be an “intentional off-side” – face-off spot in the offending team’s end zone.\\nWhen the Linesperson signals a “delayed off-side” and a defending Player shoots the puck which goes over the protective glass and \\nout of play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending zone end zone face-off spots and the defending Player \\nwould be assessed a minor penalty.\\n ➔ Rule 63 – Delaying the Game.\\nWhen the Linesperson signals a “delayed off-side” and the original shot deflects off a defending Player and out of play, the ensuing \\n“face-off” shall take place at the nearest face-off spot in the zone from where the puck was shot.\\nWhen the defending team is about to be penalized in the defending zone and the Linesperson has a “delayed off-side” signaled \\nagainst the attacking team on the same play, the ensuing “face-off” shall be conducted at one of the defending zone end zone face-\\noff spots.\\n83.7. INTENTIONAL OFF-SIDE\\nAn “intentional off-side” is one which is made for the purpose of securing a stoppage of play regardless of the reason, whether either \\nIIHF  OFFICIAL RULE BOOK 2025/26 – SECTION 10  143\\nGAME FLOW\\n10   SECTION · GAME FLOW\\n\\n<<<PAGE 129>>>\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nteam is “short-handed”.\\nIf, while an “off-side call is delayed”, a Player of the offending team deliberately touches the puck to create a stoppage of play, the \\nLinesperson will signal an “intentional off-side”.\\nIf, in the judgement of the Linesperson, the attacking Player(s) are making an effort to exit the attacking zone and are in close pro- \\nximity to the blue line at the time the puck is shot into the zone, the play will not be deemed to be an “intentional off-side”.\\nRULE 84  OVERTIME OPERATIONS\\n84.1. OVERTIME OPERATIONS – ROUND ROBIN OR PRELIMINARY ROUND GAME \\nIf at the end of the three (3) regular twenty (20) minutes periods in a single Round Robin IIHF Championship or the Preliminary Round \\nof a top category IIHF Championship, the two (2) playing teams are tied, the teams will then play a “sudden death” overtime period \\nof not more than five (5) minutes with the team scoring first declared the winner.\\nThe overtime period shall be played with each team at a numerical strength of three (3) skaters and one (1) goalkeeper.\\nThe overtime period will commence following a three-minute (3) intermission during which time a “shoveling” of the ice surface by \\narena personnel will be performed utilizing the same procedure as during “television commercial breaks”. Once the intermission has \\nbeen completed, the clock will be reset to 5:00 minutes and the overtime period will begin immediately. Teams will not change ends. \\nThe Players will remain at their respective Players’ benches during the 3-minute (3) intermission in which the “shoveling” of the ice \\nsurface takes place.

Teams are not permitted to \\nreturn to the dressing room during this time.\\n84.2. OVERTIME EXTRA ATTACKER\\nA team shall be allowed to pull its goalkeeper in favor of an additional skater in the overtime period.\\n84.3. OVERTIME PENAL TIES\\nWhen regulation time ends, and the teams are 5 on 3, teams will start the overtime period with 5 on 3. Once Player strength reaches \\n5 on 4 or 5 on 5, at the next stoppage of play, Player strength is adjusted to 4 on 3 or 3 on 3, as appropriate.\\nWhen regulation time ends, and teams are 4 on 4, teams will start overtime 3 on 3.
